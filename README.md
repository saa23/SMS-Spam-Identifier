# SMS-Spam-Identifier

This project is about building a classification model to create a SMS classifier (whether spam or ham). The dataset is a real SMS dataset with a spam/ ham label for each message. The process involved text mining and Naïve-Bayes algorithm.
Making a report of the approach used in building the model classifier.

The report should have a clear explanation of:<br />

•	**Data Preprocess**<br />
Show how you feature engineered the attributes you are going to use in your model.<br />
•	**Model Selection** <br />
In building the model, we should consider multiple parameters in coming up with the best model.<br />
•	**Predicting Spam SMS**<br /> 
Based on the best model picked in previous step, use the model to predict SMS messages stored in `data/submissionSMS.csv`.<br />
